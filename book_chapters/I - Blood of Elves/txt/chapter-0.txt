CHAPTER ONE 

The town was in flames. 
The narrow streets leading to the moat and the first terrace belched smoke and embers, flames devouring 
the densely clustered thatched houses and licking at the castle walls. From the west, from the harbour 
gate, the screams and clamour of vicious battle and the dull blows of a battering ram smashing against the 
walls grew ever louder. 
Their attackers had surrounded them unexpectedly, shattering the barricades which had been held by no 
more than a few soldiers, a handful of townsmen carrying halberds and some crossbowmen from the 
guild. Their horses, decked out in flowing black caparisons, flew over the barricades like spectres, their 
riders' bright, glistening blades sowing death amongst the fleeing defenders. 
Ciri felt the knight who carried her before him on his saddle abruptly spur his horse. She heard his cry. 
'Hold on,' he shouted. 'Hold on!' 
Other knights wearing the colours of Cintra overtook them, sparring, even in full flight, with the 
Nilfgaardians. Ciri caught a glimpse of the skirmish from the corner of her eye - the crazed swirl of 
blue-gold and black cloaks amidst the clash of steel, the clatter of blades against shields, the neighing of 
horses- 
Shouts. No, not shouts. Screams. 
'Hold on!' 
Fear. With every jolt, every jerk, every leap of the horse pain shot through her hands as she clutched at 
the reins. Her legs contracted painfully, unable to find support, her eyes watered from the smoke. The 
arm around her suffocated her, choking her, the force compressing her ribs. All around her screaming 


such as she had never before heard grew louder. What must one do to a man to make him scream so? 
Fear. Overpowering, paralysing, choking fear. 
Again the clash of iron, the grunts and snorts of the horses. The houses whirled around her and suddenly 
she could see windows belching fire where a moment before there'd been nothing but a muddy little street 
strewn with corpses and cluttered with the abandoned possessions of the fleeing population. All at once 
the knight at her back was wracked by a strange wheezing cough. Blood spurted over the hands grasping 
the reins. More screams. Arrows whistled past. 
A fall, a shock, painful bruising against armour. Hooves pounded past her, a horse's belly and a frayed 
girth flashing by above her head, then another horse's belly and a flowing black caparison. Grunts of 
exertion, like a lumberjack's when chopping wood. But this isn't wood; it's iron against iron. A shout, 
muffled and dull, and something huge and black collapsed into the mud next to her with a splash, spurting 
blood. An armoured foot quivered, thrashed, goring the earth with an enormous spur. 
A jerk. Some force plucked her up, pulled her onto another saddle. Hold on! Again the bone-shaking 
speed, the mad gallop. Arms and legs desperately searching for support. The horse rears. Hold on! ... 
There is no support. There is no ... There is no ... There is blood. The horse falls. It's impossible to 
jump aside, no way to break free, to escape the tight embrace of these chainmail-clad arms. There is no 
way to avoid the blood pouring onto her head and over her shoulders. 
A jolt, the squelch of mud, a violent collision with the ground, horrifically still after the furious ride. The 
horse's harrowing wheezes and squeals as it tries to regain its feet. The pounding of horseshoes, fetlocks 
and hooves flashing past. Black caparisons and cloaks. Shouting. 
The street is on fire, a roaring red wall of flame. Silhouetted before it, a rider towers over the flaming 
roofs, enormous. His black-caparisoned horse prances, tosses its head, neighs. 
The rider stares down at her. Ciri sees his eyes gleaming through the slit in his huge helmet, framed by a 
bird of prey's wings. She sees the fire reflected in the broad blade of the sword held in his lowered hand. 
The rider looks at her. Ciri is unable to move. The dead man's motionless arms wrapped around her 
waist hold her down. She is locked in place by something heavy and wet with blood, something which is 
lying across her thigh, pinning her to the ground. 
And she is frozen in fear: a terrible fear which turns her entrails inside out, which deafens Ciri to the 
screams of the wounded horse, the roar of the blaze, the cries of dying people and the pounding drums. 
The only thing which exists, which counts, which still has any meaning, is fear. Fear embodied in the figure 
of a black knight wearing a helmet decorated with feathers frozen against the wall of raging, red flames. 
The rider spurs his horse, the wings on his helmet fluttering as the bird of prey takes to flight, launching 
itself to attack its helpless victim, paralysed with fear. The bird - or maybe the knight -screeches 
terrifyingly, cruelly, triumphantly. A black horse, black armour, a black flowing cloak, and behind this flames. 
A sea of flames. 
Fear. 
The bird shrieks. The wings beat, feathers slap against her face. Fear! 
Help! Why doesn't anyone help me? Alone, weak, helpless - I can't move, can't force a sound from my 
constricted throat. Why does no one come to help me? 
I'm terrified! 
Eyes blaze through the slit in the huge winged helmet. The black cloak veils everything- 
'Ciri!' 
She woke, numb and drenched in sweat, with her scream - the scream which had woken her - still 
hanging in the air, still vibrating somewhere within her, beneath her breast-bone and burning against her 
parched throat. Her hands ached, clenched around the blanket; her back ached ... 
'Ciri. Calm down.'

the ground. There was no other fire and no other iron. The hand against her cheek smelled of leather and 
ashes. Not of blood. 
'Geralt-' 
'It was just a dream. A bad dream.' 
Ciri shuddered violently, curling her arms and legs up tight. 
A dream. Just a dream. 
The campfire had already died down; the birch logs were red and luminous, occasionally crackling, giving 
off tiny spurts of blue flame which illuminated the white hair and sharp profile of the man wrapping a 
blanket and sheepskin around her. 
'Geralt, I-' 
'I'm right here. Sleep, Ciri. You have to rest. We've still a long way ahead of us.' 
I can hear music, she thought suddenly. Amidst the rustling of the trees ... there's music. Lute music. 
And voices. The Princess of Cintra ... A child of destiny ... A child of Elder Blood, the blood of elves. 
Geralt of Rivia, the White Wolf, and his destiny. No, no, that's a legend. A poet's invention. The princess 
is dead. She was killed in the town streets while trying to escape ... 
Hold on...! Hold ... 
'Geralt?' 
'What, Ciri?' 
'What did he do to me? What happened? What did he ... do to me?' 
'Who?' 
'The knight ... The black knight with feathers on his helmet ... I can't remember anything. He shouted . . 
. and looked at me. I can't remember what happened. Only that I was frightened ... I was so frightened 
...' 


The man leaned over her, the flame of the campfire sparkling in his eyes. They were strange eyes. Very 
strange. Ciri had been frightened of them, she hadn't liked meeting his gaze. But that had been a long time 
ago. A very long time ago. 
'I can't remember anything,' she whispered, searching for his hand, as tough and coarse as raw wood. 
'The black knight-' 
'It was a dream. Sleep peacefully. It won't come back.' 
Ciri had heard such reassurances in the past. They had been repeated to her endlessly; many, many times 
she had been offered comforting words when her screams had woken her during the night. But this time it 
was different. Now she believed it. Because it was Geralt of Rivia, the White Wolf, the Witcher, who 
said it. The man who was her destiny. The one for whom she was destined. Geralt the Witcher, who had 
found her surrounded by war, death and despair, who had taken her with him and promised they would 
never part. 
She fell asleep holding tight to his hand. 
The bard finished the song. Tilting his head a little he repeated the ballad's refrain on his lute, delicately, 
softly, a single tone higher than the apprentice accompanying him. 
No one said a word. Nothing but the subsiding music and the whispering leaves and squeaking boughs of 
the enormous oak could be heard. Then, all of a sudden, a goat tethered to one of the carts which circled 
the ancient tree bleated lengthily. At that moment, as if given a signal, one of the men seated in the large 
semi-circular audience stood up. Throwing his cobalt blue cloak with gold braid trim back over his 
shoulder, he gave a stiff, dignified bow. 
'Thank you, Master Dandelion,' he said, his voice resonant without being loud. 'Allow me, Radcliffe of 
Oxenfurt, Master of the Arcana, to express what I am sure is the opinion of everyone here present and 
utter words of gratitude and appreciation for your fine art and skill.' 
The wizard ran his gaze over those assembled - an audience of well over a hundred people - seated on 
the ground, on carts, or standing in a tight semi-circle facing the foot of the oak. They nodded and 
whispered amongst themselves. Several people began to applaud while others greeted the singer with 
upraised hands. Women, touched by the music, sniffed and wiped their eyes on whatever came to hand, 



which differed according to their standing, profession and wealth: peasant women used their forearms or 
the backs of their hands, merchants' wives dabbed their eyes with linen handkerchiefs while elves and 
noblewomen used kerchiefs of the finest tight-woven cotton, and Baron Vilibert's three daughters, who 
had, along with the rest of his retinue, halted their falcon hunt to attend the famous troubadour's 
performance, blew their noses loudly and sonorously into elegant mould-green cashmere scarves. 
'It would not be an exaggeration to say,' continued the wizard, 'that you have moved us deeply, Master 
Dandelion. You have prompted us to reflection and thought; you have stirred our hearts. Allow me to 
express our gratitude, and our respect.' 
The troubadour stood and took a bow, sweeping the heron feather pinned to his fashionable hat across 
his knees. His apprentice broke off his playing, grinned and bowed too, until Dandelion glared at him 
sternly and snapped something under his breath. The boy lowered his head and returned to softly 
strumming his lute strings. 
The assembly stirred to life. The merchants travelling in the caravan whispered amongst themselves and 
then rolled a sizable cask of beer out to the foot of the oak tree. Wizard Radcliffe lost himself in quiet 
conversation with Baron Vilibert. Having blown their noses, the baron's daughters gazed at Dandelion in 
adoration -which went entirely unnoticed by the bard, engrossed as he was in smiling, winking and 
flashing his teeth at a haughty, silent group of roving elves, and at one of them in particular: a dark-haired, 
large-eyed beauty sporting a tiny ermine cap. Dandelion had rivals for her attention - the elf, with her huge 
eyes and beautiful torque hat, had caught his audience's interest as well, and a number of knights, 
students and goliards were paying court to her with their eyes. The elf clearly enjoyed the attention, 
picking at the lace cuffs of her chemise and fluttering her eyelashes, but the group of elves with her 
surrounded her on all sides, not bothering to hide their antipathy towards her admirers. 
The glade beneath Bleobheris, the great oak, was a place of frequent rallies, a well-known travellers' 
resting place and meeting ground for wanderers, and was famous for its tolerance and openness. The 
druids protecting the ancient tree called it the Seat of Friendship and willingly welcomed all comers. But 
even during an event as exceptional as the world-famous troubadour's just-concluded performance the 
travellers kept to themselves, remaining in clearly delineated groups. Elves stayed with elves. Dwarfish 
craftsmen gathered with their kin, who were often hired to protect the merchant caravans and were 
armed to the teeth. Their groups tolerated at best the gnome miners and halfling farmers who camped 
beside them. All non-humans were uniformly distant towards humans. The humans repaid in kind, but 
were not seen to mix amongst themselves either. Nobility looked down on the merchants and travelling 
salesmen with open scorn, while soldiers and mercenaries distanced themselves from shepherds and their 
reeking sheepskins. The few wizards and their disciples kept themselves entirely apart from the others, 
and bestowed their arrogance on everyone in equal parts. A tight-knit, dark and silent group of peasants 
lurked in the background. Resembling a forest with their rakes, pitchforks and flails poking above their 
heads, they were ignored by all and sundry. 
The exception, as ever, was the children. Freed from the constraints of silence which had been enforced 
during the bard's performance, the children dashed into the woods with wild cries, and enthusiastically 
immersed themselves in a game whose rules were incomprehensible to all those who had bidden farewell 
to the happy years of childhood. Children of elves, dwarves, halflings, gnomes, half-elves, quarter-elves 
and toddlers of mysterious provenance neither knew nor recognised racial or social divisions. At least, 
not yet. 
'Indeed!' shouted one of the knights present in the glade, who was as thin as a beanpole and wearing a 
red and black tunic emblazoned with three lions passant. 'The wizard speaks the truth!
